        "The academic discipline of artificial intelligence was founded at a research workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since.[16] Since its founding, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[17] These concepts of automated art date back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music.[18][19] The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, such as Maillardet's automaton, created in the early 1800s.[20]\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works. By the early 1970s, Harold Cohen was creating and exhibiting generative AI works created by AARON, the computer program Cohen created to generate paintings.[21]\n",
        "\n",
        "Markov chains have long been used to model natural languages since their development by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the early 20th century. Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906,[22][23][24] and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.[25][26]\n",
        "\n",
        "The field of machine learning often uses statistical models, including generative models, to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models, due to the difficulty of generative modeling.[27]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative, rather than discriminative, models of complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first able to output not only class labels for images, but to output entire images.\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018.[28] This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2 which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model.[29]\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2021, the release of DALL-E, a transformer-based pixel generative model, followed by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion marked the emergence of practical high-quality artificial intelligence art from natural language prompts.\n",

        "In March 2023, GPT-4 was released. A team from Microsoft Research argued that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".[30]. Other scholars have disputed that GPT-4 reaches this threshold, calling generative AI \"still far from reaching the benchmark of ‘general human intelligence’\" as of 2023.[31]\n",

Clarify the definition of \"churn\" and its impact on the business.  Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for success (e.g., reduction in churn rate by X%). Document all requirements and expectations.\n    * Initial brainstorming session with the data science team to explore potential approaches and data requirements.\n    * Define the scope of the project, including which customer segments will be analyzed and what types of churn predictions are needed (e.g., short-term, long-term).\n\n* **Day 2:**\n    * Research existing literature and industry best practices related to telecom churn prediction.\n    * Develop a preliminary project plan, including timelines, resource allocation, and potential risks.\n    * Refine the KPIs and success metrics based on the initial research and stakeholder discussions.\n\n* **Day 3:**\n    * Finalize the project scope and objectives document.  Get stakeholder sign-off on the document.\n    * Prepare a detailed data requirements document outlining the necessary data fields and their expected formats.\n    * Assign tasks to team members based on their expertise.\n\n\n**Step 2: Data Understanding (5 days)**\n\n* **Day 1:**\n    * Access and initial inspection of the dataset (20,000+ customer records).  Identify the data types of each feature.\n    * Check for data completeness (missing values) and consistency.  Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each numerical feature.\n    * Document initial observations and potential data quality issues.\n\n* **Day 2:**\n    * Explore the distribution of the target variable (\"churn\").  Analyze the class imbalance (proportion of churned vs. non-churned customers).\n    * Investigate the relationships between the target variable and other features using descriptive statistics and basic visualizations (histograms, box plots).\n    * Identify potential outliers and anomalies in the data.\n\n* **Day 3:**\n    * Perform correlation analysis between features to identify potential multicollinearity.\n    * Deep dive into categorical features (contract, payment method, etc.) to understand their distribution and potential impact on churn.\n    * Document findings and potential data transformations needed.\n\n* **Day 4:**\n    * Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample of the data to gain a deeper understanding of the data patterns and relationships.\n    * Develop hypotheses about the factors driving customer churn based on the EDA findings.\n    * Refine the data requirements document based on the EDA results.\n\n* **Day 5:**\n    * Document the data understanding phase, including key findings, challenges, and proposed solutions.\n    * Prepare a presentation summarizing the data understanding phase for the team and stakeholders.\n\n\n**Step 3: Data Cleaning (7 days)**\n\n* **Day 1-2:** Handle missing values.  Decide on imputation strategies (mean, median, mode, or more sophisticated techniques) based on the nature of the missing data and the feature type. Implement chosen strategies.\n* **Day 3-4:** Address outliers.  Decide on outlier treatment strategies (removal, transformation, or capping). Implement chosen strategies.  Justify the chosen methods.\n* **Day 5:** Data transformation.  Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (one-hot encoding, label encoding).  Scale or normalize numerical features if necessary (standardization, min-max scaling).\n* **Day 6:** Data consistency checks.  Ensure data consistency across different features and identify and resolve any inconsistencies.\n* **Day 7:** Data validation.  Verify the accuracy and completeness of the cleaned data.  Document all data cleaning steps and decisions.\n\n\n**Step 4: Data Exploration (5 days)**\n\n* **Day 1-2:**  In-depth EDA focusing on relationships between features and churn.  Use advanced visualization techniques (scatter plots, heatmaps, pair plots).\n* **Day 3:** Feature engineering.  Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., combining monthly charges and total charges).\n* **Day 4:** Feature selection.  Select the most relevant features for model building using techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance scores, or recursive feature elimination.\n* **Day 5:** Document findings from the data exploration phase, including insights gained and feature engineering/selection decisions.\n\n\n**Step 5: Data Visualization (5 days)**\n\n* **Day 1-2:** Create visualizations to communicate key findings from the data exploration phase to stakeholders.  Focus on clear and concise visualizations that highlight important trends and patterns.\n* **Day 3-4:** Develop interactive dashboards to allow stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights independently.\n* **Day 5:** Prepare a presentation summarizing the key visualizations and insights.\n\n\n**Step 6: Machine Learning (7 days)**\n\n* **Day 1-2:** Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n* **Day 3-4:** Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting).  Tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or cross-validation.\n* **Day 5:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).  Select the best-performing model based on the chosen metrics and business requirements.\n* **Day 6:**  Perform model diagnostics to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.\n* **Day 7:** Document the model selection process, including model performance metrics and rationale for choosing the final model.\n\n\n**Step 7: Results Evaluation (2 days)**\n\n* **Day 1:**  Thoroughly evaluate the performance of the chosen model on the test set.  Assess the model's robustness and generalizability.\n* **Day 2:**  Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the model's performance, limitations, and potential areas for future improvement.\n\n\n**Step 8: Business Presentation (2 days)**\n\n* **Day 1:**  Prepare a presentation summarizing the project findings and recommendations for the telecom company.  Focus on communicating the key insights in a clear and concise manner.\n* **Day 2:**  Present the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.  Address any questions or concerns.  Discuss next steps and potential future work.\n"
